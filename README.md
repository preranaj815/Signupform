We are going to implement a glass morphism effect for the sign-up form and integrate a shooting star animation in the background.
To create a more polished sign-up form with enhanced glass morphism and a captivating shooting star animation,we'll incorporate additional CSS for styling and JavaScript for form validation.
This version adds some improvements such as:
Adjusted opacity for better readability of form fields.
Increased blur effect for a more pronounced glass morphism effect.
Limited the maximum width of the form for better readability on larger screens.
Added a smooth transition effect when hovering over the submit button.
Included 'required' attribute for mandatory fields.
